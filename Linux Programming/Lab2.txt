Question 1
Write a Linux shell script to perform the following tasks in a given 
directory using “for” loop: 


Code:

echo "A – Change all files with .sh extension to executable for all 
users"
echo "B – Move these *.sh files to another directory" 
echo "C – Execute each of these .sh files"
echo
read -p "Enter your option: " option
echo
if [[ "$option" == "A" ]];
 then
 for name in *.sh;
 do
 
 chmod +x $name
 done
elif [[ "$option" == "B" ]];
 then
 read -p "Enter directory to move .sh files: " directname
 for name in *.sh;
 do
 
 mv $name $directname
 
 done
elif [[ "$option" == "C" ]];
 then
 for name in *.sh;
 do
 
 sh $name
 
 done
 
fi


Question 2
Write a Linux shell script that performs the following tasks: 
	a. Provide a mystery integer between 1 to 10. 
	b. Using “while” loop, allow the user to guess the random number until the user got it right. 
	c. If the user’s entered number is lower or greater than the random number, notify the user to guess higher or lower respectively. 
	d. If the user enters any number out of the 1 to 10 range, notify the user to enter in the correct number range. 
	e. Display a congratulatory message along with the random number if the user guessed it correctly. 

Code:

guess=0
random=0
random=$(($(($RANDOM%10))+1))
while [[ $guess -ne $random ]];
do
read -p "Guess the Number until you get right: " guess
if [[ $guess -gt 10 || $guess -lt 0 ]];
then
 echo "guess not within the range"
 
elif [[ $guess -gt $random ]];
then
 echo "guess lesser"
 
elif [[ $guess -lt $random ]];
then
 echo "guess bigger"
 
fi
done 
echo "CONGRATULATION! You Guessed the Number"
